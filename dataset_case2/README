# Short format description

Each row represent a case: A interval without any changes to the chokes.
Each column is some statistic calculated on the interval for a given measurement.

First column is index (case number)

Columns applicable to all wells
- T1   : Start time of case (milliseconds since epoch)
- T2   : End time of case (milliseconds since epoch)

General column name format for well measurement
$WELL_$MEASUREMENT_$STAT

$WELL on of W1, W2, W3, W4, W5, W6, W7

$MEASUREMENT one of
- CHK  : Choke opening in percentage
- QOIL : Oil rate (Sm3/h I believe)
- QGAS : Gas rate (MMSm3/h I believe)
- PBH  : Bottom hole pressure (NB: measurements for W4, W6 and W7 are low quality)
- PWH  : Well head pressure
- PDC  : Downstream choke pressure

Relevant $STATs:
- wsp_mea : Weak stationary process mean (NB: nan when the interval have no samples)
- wsp_sem : Weak stationary process standard error (NB: nan when the interval have no samples)
- mea     : Sample mean
- var     : Sample variance
- med     : Median
- max     : Max value
- min     : Min value
- num_num : Number of proper samples
- num_nan : Number of NaN valued samples

There's some other stats included but those are most likely not relevant.

# Misc

- Read csv into pandas: pd.read_csv(PATH, index_col=0)
- Some choke values are negative. Clamping these to 0 is probably a good idea.
